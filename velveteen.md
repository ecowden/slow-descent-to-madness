# Velveteen

## Overview

Paraphrasing Kurt:

```
Based loosely on the first twenty minutes of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it's the most 
dancy of our songs. I was going for something that wasn't based on guitars. In 
that sense, it's a total failure, but it's still a fun song.
```

## Recording Plan:

First, record drums and bass DI alone. Next, overdub guitars and vocals separately. (Groundbreaking, right?)

### Drums

 - **Overheads**. Spaced pair of Gefell UMT 70 LDCs into JLM 1290. I'm positioning them higher than with
    _Out of Mind_ and also setting the pick up pattern to figure-eight. You're welcome to tell me that they sound
    terrible.
 - **Snare Top**. Heil PR30 into ClassicAPI VP26.
 - **Snare Bottom**. Heil PR28 into ClassicAPI VP26.
 - **Kick**. Heil PR40 into Dual JLM 99V. Mic located inside the kick drum angled a few inches from the beater.
 - **Hi-Hats**. Gefell M300 into LOLA.
 - **Rack Tom 1**. Heil PR20 into JLM BA "clean".
 - **Rack Tom 2**. Heil PR20 into JLM BA "clean".
 - **Floor Tom**. Heil PR40 into JLM BA "mutt". 
 - **Ride**. AKG C3000b into JLM BA "312".
 - **Room**. Gefell M300 as far from the kit as possible, up near the corner of the room.

### Bass
_I'll start by recording Bass DI simulaneously with the drums. Especially with Velveteen, it feels important
to get a good take with drums and bass locked together._

_We can optionally re-record bass with a DI and mic'd 
cab later, but I want the cab muted when recording drums to avoid bleed._
