## About the Song

Paraphrasing Kurt:

```
Based loosely on the first twenty minutes of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it's the most 
dancy of our songs. I was going for something that wasn't based on guitars. In that sense, 
it's a total failure, but it's still a fun song.
```

## Recording Plan

First, record drums and bass DI alone. Next, overdub guitars and vocals separately. (Groundbreaking, right?)
This is a departure from our original plan of recording everyone simultanesouly so that we can reduce bleed
into the drum mics.

We'll do a dry run Monday, September 30th, splitting the time between drums/bass and overdubs. The goal will
be to try out the recording process and arrangement, creating a draft that we can send to David for review.
We want to get good performances, but our goal is not to get absolute perfect performances.

Depending on feedback, we can use our two nights the following week to get real tracks, splitting the nights
between drums/bass and overdubs as necessary, fixing any issues the previous session uncovers and focusing 
on performance.

### Drums

 - **Overheads**. Spaced pair of Gefell UMT 70s into JLM 1290. _I'm positioning them higher than on
    _Out of Mind_ and also setting the pick up pattern to figure-eight, 'cause I'm kinda digging the extra
    bit of ambiance in an otherwise dry room. You're welcome to tell me that they sound terrible._
 - **Snare Top**. Heil PR30 into ClassicAPI VP26.
 - **Snare Bottom**. Heil PR28 into ClassicAPI VP26.
 - **Kick**. Heil PR40 into JLM Dual 99V. Mic located inside the kick drum angled a few inches from the beater.
 - **Hi-Hats**. Gefell M300 into Hairball Lola.
 - **Rack Tom 1**. Heil PR20 into JLM BA.
 - **Rack Tom 2**. Heil PR20 into JLM BA.
 - **Floor Tom**. Heil PR40 into JLM BA.
 - **Ride**. AKG C3000b into JLM BA.
 - **Room**. Gefell M300 as far from the kit as possible, up near the corner of the room.

### Bass

_I'll start by recording Bass DI simulaneously with the drums. Especially with Velveteen, it feels important
to get a good take with drums and bass locked together._

_We can optionally re-record bass with a DI and mic'd cab later, but I feel that we need the cab muted when recording 
drums to avoid bleed._

 - DI through amp head into Hairball Lola.

### Vocals

 - Gefell UMT 70 into ClassicAPI VP28.

### Rhythm Guitar

 - **Near**. Heil PR30 into ClassicAPI VP28.
 - **Far**. I'm open to suggestions. Mono or stereo? Are there any specific qualities you'd like me to try
    and pick up?

### Lead Guitar

 - **Near**. Heil PR30 into JLM Dual 99V.
 - **Far**. I'm open to suggestions. Mono or stereo? Are there any specific qualities you'd like me to try
    and pick up?
